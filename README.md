# Colors are funky, and so is Canvas

A rgb - hex thing with sliders that change the background color.

It also has a funky animation made in Canvas.

Ignore the repo name, it's called switching project ideas mid-development

## But why? What are you doing?
Well, school projects are a thing, and this is part of that.\
And I am learning javascript canvas while at that

## What is your goal?
To finish my mandatory, duh. Code isn't great but it might give you some ideas for your own projects

## How to install and use

### Running the app
Simply open the index.html in your preferred browser. As long as it's not Internet Explorer it should run properly.

### Live Reloading
The app is livereloading-compatible. Use [Budo](https://github.com/mattdesl/budo) to easy run your app while testing.\
To run the app run this command in the source root directory _(where your index.js is)_\
`npx budo index.js --live --open`\
This will automatically run and open the app in your browser.

### Working version

If you fail to run it locally for any reason (there could be many I guess), you can just use the [github pages version](https://kwandes.github.io/clock/src/index.html)
