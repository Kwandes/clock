# clock
It goes tick, tok, tick, tok\
Or it it digital and just shows the numbers, whatever fits you.

## But why? What are you doing?
Well, school projects are a thing, and this is part of that.\
And I am learning javascript canvas while at that

## What is your goal?
A clock, duh. It will show time, maybe even the timezone. But the format...will be based of how I feel.

## How to install and use
The app is quite minimalistic at the moment, but may grow in the future.

### Running the app
Simply open the index.html in your preffered browser. As long as it's not Internet Explorer it should run properly.

### Live Reloading
The app is livereloading-compatible. Use [Budo](https://github.com/mattdesl/budo) to easy run your app while testing.\
To run the app run this command in the source root directory _(where your index.js is)_\
`npx budo index.js --live --open`\
This will automatically run and open the app in your browser.
